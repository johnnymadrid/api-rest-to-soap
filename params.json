  "body": "### API REST To SOAP\r\nAlthough both technologies are related to web services. Here you will find an implementation to accessing SOAP Services using an endpoint as a REST service. The main idea to use this kind of implementation is to maintain easily the accessibility SOAP services, which developers are commonly struggling to understand large numbers of XML tags, a structure of a tree with namespaces privately. In other words, this implementation of the REST service makes an understandable start of a point to use another service, which has been implemented in other technology, using JSON messages.\r\n\r\n### What is JSON?\r\nAlthough it is not the goal to explain extensibly JSON and benefits about this language, below are the short definition to start; \r\n- JSON means <b>J</b>avaScript <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation, \r\n- It is open standard format and \"<b>human readable</b> text to transmit data composed of attribute value-key pairs,\r\n- Related to the official Internet media type `application/json`,\r\n- It is an independent language using Javascript format but is text, \r\n- Extension file is `.json` \r\n\r\n\r\n### SOAP Service concerning\r\nThe chosen example for this API implemented is the SOAP Service - TShirt Service published in the following URL `http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/`. Its WSDL definition is [here](http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io?wsdl). \r\n\r\nThe SOAP Service is part of the extensive services published in the integration platform service in Mulesoft ([CloudHub](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/cloudhub)). \r\n\r\nImportant information must a read if you are driven to implant a [Cloud Integration](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/cloudhub-faq). \r\n\r\nFeel free to swap the service you want to consume for that one you are interested in your organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJohnny Madrid (@johnnymadrid) is a GitHub user who is extending his technology acknowledge about API Integration between corporations using innovative and current technologies.
